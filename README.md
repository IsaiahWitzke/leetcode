# leetcode

### Usage
1. Create a folder called `[question name]` if it doesn't already exist
2. Create a `README.md` within the folder and link the leetcode question
3. Upload your solution to the folder with file naming `[github username]`

Note: if the folder already exists just do step 3

### Learning
* try adding multiple solutions/improving your original solution as you learn
* take a look at other solutions in the folder/ask others to try out your question
* if you aren't sure why your solution isn't working/want eyes on it open a PR for others to review
